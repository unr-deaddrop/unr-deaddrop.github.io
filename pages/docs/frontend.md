## Details 
The design of the DeadDrop server frontend has undergone multiple evolutions over the course of this project's development, and may continue to undergo further changes in time. Growing from what was originally intended to be just a command line interface to a full stack "frontend" developed in sveltekit that interacts with Django.

### Early Protoypes
The earliest prototypes were drawn up in canva and eventually implemented in sveltekit using images and svgs in place of any real elements like the build.

### Mockup
Eventually we got around to developing a more fleshed out mockup of a command and control server with more the features that cybersecurity professional would want.

### Current Iteration
The older mockup was then inmplemented in sveltekit using the red and white color scheme that was landed on in the prototype.
